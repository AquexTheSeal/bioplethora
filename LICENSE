                        BAEDOOR MOD LICENSE
                       Version 1, 1 May 2022

                        created by Toma400
                         (Tomasz Stępień)

License created originally to distinct Baedoor mods from other art
(since mods differ by copyrights inherited from parent game) and
to set distinction between All Rights Reserved and Baedoor Mod
License (later: BML), since BML gives you some more possibilities.
=======
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

As much as it is private license for Toma400's mods, all modders
are welcome to use BML for their own purposes, with requirement to
not remove anything but section 4 (if it is redundant).
If license is edited, it should be stated explicitly in its first
paragraph that it is modified.

License may change in the future with next iterations.
For software under BML license I will use term "product". Parent
game for mod (for which it was made for) is called as "core game".


1. GENERAL LICENSE
Baedoor Mod License prohibits use of any product's contents - by
that it is meant code and assets in their broad sense - if not stated
in section 2.
Content copyrights belong to product's owner (or team, if stated so).

Any exceptions in copyrights' holding or specific licenses being used
for part of product's contents are stated explicitly on either
product's distribution page, readme, license or EULA.
If more than one license is used for product's contents, BML is
applied only to contents not being under any other license.


2. CONTENT USE EXCEPTIONS
Any use of product's contents has to be discussed with copyrights owner
before it gets used for any purpose, unless it is meant to be used for:

  2.1. Mod compatibility with the product, which isn't blatant copy-paste
       of content feature and is within core game EULA
    -> "Compatibility feature" needs to add feature that is exclusive
       and wasn't done in any of those mods. Most of compatibilities
       should count here, but this subsection is here to protect from
       copy-pasting product's feature and calling it "compatibility".
    -> Compatibility has to follow core game EULA, so if said agreement
       prohibits selling of mods, compatibility software using product's
       contents should not be sold, to comply that EULA.

  2.2. Porting the product to another core game version, if copyright's
       owner is not active nor reachable via any provided social media
       for over a year
    -> You need explicit permission from author to port product to
       another core game version or API, if said author is active.
    -> If author is unreachable by any means for more than one year,
       you are granted to use its contents ONLY to port the mod to
       another core game version or API, and to maintain it.
       This permission is granted until author becomes active again.
       Person who ports product should leave message for author(s) for
       them to know that product is being ported and that they can
       inspect it.
    -> Author who came back after such long break has right to do
       anything with said port, though users of BML license are asked
       to not overuse this right as stated here.
    -> Porting author has also to directly mention and link to
       original mod in visible place of their site, and is asked to
       put mod's author in team's section (if publishing site offers
       such feature), and if publishing site has possibility to grant
       you any benefits from downloads, porting author needs to set
       at least 25% of benefits to original author of the mod.


3. REDISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCT AND WAYS OF USE
Baedoor Mod License does not allow for further redistribution of the
product.
BML allows user to:

  3.1. Using the product for its intended purpose (playing within core
       game environment)
  3.2. Changing product for their own private purposes (not being
         shared with anyone)
  3.3. Creating new creative public content based on the product
       (gameplay videos)
  3.4. Creating modpacks with product

As long as none of the above breaks core game EULA.
